            <div className="text">‚ÄúJoker‚Äù is not your typical comic book film. It abandons the flashy action and superpowered spectacle in favor of a dark, psychological exploration of a man on the edge. Set in a grim, decaying Gotham City, the film paints a bleak portrait of Arthur Fleck a struggling comedian battling mental illness, isolation, and a society that constantly turns its back on him. This is a haunting character study, one that strips away the glossy veneer of traditional superhero narratives and replaces it with raw, uncomfortable realism. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a transformative, career-defining performance, capturing Arthur's slow descent into madness with chilling precision. His portrayal is both heartbreaking and disturbing, making ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù a powerful, unsettling commentary on mental health, neglect, and the consequences of a broken system.</div>

              Starring Ana de Armas as Rooney, a deadly ballerina-assassin
              trained at the same ruthless institution seen in John Wick:
              Chapter 3, the film follows her journey of vengeance after her
              family is murdered. Rooney dances between grace and violence as
              she tracks down those responsible, blending ballet precision with
              brutal action. With appearances from Keanu Reeves (John Wick) and
              Ian McShane (Winston), Ballerina expands the Wickverse with its
              stylish cinematography, choreographed gun-fu, and a deeper
              emotional arc.
